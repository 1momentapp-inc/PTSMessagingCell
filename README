The PTSMessagingCell class provides the basic functionalities of a messaging cell as used in the iOS Messaging App or WhatsApp. It can be used like a normal UITableView cell, where you can set all the properties in the 

- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath

method. See the demo project for an example how to use the class.

The class was tested in an application, using data that was fetched from a persistent store with Core Data. So lots of data and long message texts should not be problem. 

IMPORTANT: The sizing of the cells is handled in the data sources 

-(CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath

method. This is not very elegant but I did not come up with a better solution yet.

The class should be working on the iPhone (3.3 inch & 4inch) and iPad (although I only really tested the iPhones) and with all interface-orientations.
